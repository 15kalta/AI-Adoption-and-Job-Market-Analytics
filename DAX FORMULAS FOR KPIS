1️⃣ AI Adoption Rate by Industry (%)

Formula:

AI Adoption Rate (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Original_dataset), Original_dataset[AI_Adoption] IN {"Medium","High"}),
    COUNTROWS(Original_dataset)
) * 100


Description:
Calculates the percentage of jobs with Medium or High AI Adoption out of total jobs.

    VALUES(Original_dataset[Automation_Risk_Level]),
    CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Original_dataset[Salary]))
)


Description:
Compares average salary across Low, Medium, and High automation risk job groups.
Usage: Place Automation Risk Level in Rows, and this measure in Values.

3️⃣ Risk-Adjusted Salary Index

Formula:

Risk Adjusted Salary = 
AVERAGEX(
    Original_dataset,
    Original_dataset[Salary] * (1 - (Original_dataset[Automation_Risk_Score] / 3))
)


Description:
Adjusts salaries by reducing them based on automation risk. Helps measure the long-term sustainable salary value of jobs.
Usage: Add as a measure in Power Pivot, then compare across industries or roles.

4️⃣ Projected High-Growth Roles (%)

Formula:

High Growth Roles (%) = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Original_dataset), Original_dataset[Job_Growth] = "Growth"),
    COUNTROWS(Original_dataset)
) * 100


Description:
Shows what percentage of jobs are projected to grow in the future. Helps identify future-proof careers.

5️⃣ Top 5 Skills in High-Adoption, High-Salary Jobs

Formula (Step 1 – High Salary Median Reference):

Median Salary = MEDIAN(Original_dataset[Salary])


Formula (Step 2 – Filter for High-Adoption, High-Salary):

High Adoption High Salary Jobs = 
FILTER(
    Original_dataset,
    Original_dataset[AI_Adoption] = "High" &&
    Original_dataset[Salary] > [Median Salary]
)


Formula (Step 3 – Skill Frequency):

Top Skills = 
SUMMARIZE(
    [High Adoption High Salary Jobs],
    Original_dataset[Skill],
    "Skill Count", COUNTROWS(Original_dataset)
)


Description:
Filters dataset for High AI Adoption + Above Median Salary jobs, then counts frequency of skills to find Top 5 in-demand skills.
Usage: Create a Pivot with Skill in Rows and Skill Count in Values → sort descending → take top 5.
